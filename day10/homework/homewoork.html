<p>Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or
between two teams of two players each (doubles). 
Each player uses a tennis racket strung with a cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt 
over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way
that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. If a player is unable to return the ball 
successfully, the opponent scores a point.[1][2]
Playable at all levels of society and at all ages, tennis can be played by anyone who can hold a racket,
including wheelchair users. The original forms of tennis developed in France during the late Middle 
Ages.[3] The modern form of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as 
lawn tennis.[4] It had close connections to various field 
(lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis.</p>
